To replace Travis with Github Actions you can do the following:

1. Delete your .travis.yml file from the local project.

2. Navigate to your Github repository.

3. Click Settings

4. Click Secrets

5. Click Actions

6. Click New repository secret

7. Create key/value pair secrets for AWS_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SECRET_KEY, DOCKER_USERNAME, DOCKER_PASSWORD.

Important - You do not need to create an environment or environment secrets. Doing so will cause a failure of the action without making additional changes to the workflow file.

All that is required is simply creating the repository secrets as shown below:


8. In your local development environment, create a .github directory at the root of your project

9. Create a workflows directory inside the new .github directory

10. In the workflows directory create a deploy.yaml file which should contain the following code (name does not matter):

* Remember to change your application_name, environment_name, existing_bucket_name, and region to the values used by your AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment

* Remember to check your default branch to see if it is main or master and update the branches field accordingly.
